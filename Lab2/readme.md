# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to explore two main areas. First, to define various hardware compenents and explain their function. I will discuss hard drives and memory compenents such as CPU, SSD and RAM. Then, I will go over input and output, logic gates, and the importance of ethics in device creation. Finally, I explain data representation and gain experience covnerting with decimal, binary and hexadecimal. 
## Hardware
### Hard drives and memory
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) of a computer carries out commands sent to it by software and returs results to be acted upon. It consist of multiple processors which increase processing power by providing the capability of multiple CPUs. The speed or "clock time" is measured in Hertz. In 1965 Moore's Law stated that computing power would double every 2 years and this has stood true since then. Today, however, we are reaching the point where circuits cannot be reduced much further so the rate will slow. 

There are two options available today for long term data storage within the personal computer. The traditional hard drive uses storage disk and a read/write arm to store data for later access even after the device is powered off. Given the movin components this style can develop mechanical issues. The newer solid state drive serves the same function but instead of writing data onto a spinning disk it uses flash memory to store the data. The speed of the SSD is much faster and as a result start up times have decreased. Aditionally, since there are no moving pieces things like dust entering the device or alignment issues don't effect the drive like the would a traditional hard drive.

RAM is a form of shorter term memory that requires power to continue storing data. In order for a computer to run a program it is first stored to the hard drive and then is loaded into RAM where the CPU can access it. When the memory is to low it will be sent back to the hard drive until there is enough room on the RAM for it so the CPU can access it. This significantly slows things down. Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster by increasing the amount of memeory available for data to be stored on which prevents the needed information being sent back to the hard drive in the first place. There are two speeds of RAM to be concerned with typically, 32 bit and 64 bit. Each refers to the number of bits of data transferred in one clock cycle. The old simm model could only transfer 32 bits at a time and is no longer being used in new computers. The newer dimm model is 64 bit so it can transfer twice the data in the same period of time. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
The Aritmetic Log Unit or ALU performs all mathematical operations inside the CPU. It is located within the control unit which recieves instructions from the RAM and breaks them down into commands for the specific components such as the ALU. When the control unit sends a command to the ALU it is then performed within it and then is used by the control unit as needed.
### CPU, Input & Output
One piece of equipment in particular, a self checkout, is a good exaple of the use of a CPU given some input todisplay specific output. First,it recieves input in the form of a barcode. It then converts this input into a number in binary. The CPU recieves this information and then requests instructions from the memory on how to display the information on the screen. It runs the instructions, stores the results in memory and then sends the reults in binary to the screen. The screen functions as an output device so it converts the binary into the colors and lights that allow us to see the information.
### Logic Gates
In computer processing, a logic gate takes two pieces of information, compares them and then sends out a new piece of information depending onwgat is ofund. A truth table is used to show the output you can get for every possible input. This is useful for computer programming because computers are constantly making decisions on what to do with certain pieces of information. These decisions are based on wether or not a piece of informaion is true or false based on the logic gate used.
### IEEE - Ethicallly ALigned Devices
IEEE is a professinal association that is comitted to advancing innovation and technology for the benefit of humanity. They have been a large factor in guidelines created and used by many companies involved in the creation of AI devices. The use of ethics in AI or any type pf device design is very important. It prevents the creation of devices that exculde certain demographics or harbor personal information unkowningly to the user which can be harmful. Without a set of ethical guidelines that can be regulary employed, there is nothing preventing someone from creating something that can be used to intentionally cause harm.
## Data Representation
