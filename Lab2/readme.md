# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to explore two main areas. First, to define various hardware compenents and explain their function. I will discuss hard drives and memory compenents such as CPU, SSD and RAM. Then, I explain data representation and gain experience covnerting with decimal, binary and hexadecimal. 
## Hardware
### Hard drives and memory
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) of a computer carries out commands sent to it by software and returs results to be acted upon. It consist of multiple processors which increase processing power by providing the capability of multiple CPUs. The speed or "clock time" is measured in Hertz. In 1965 Moore's Law stated that computing power would double every 2 years and this has stood true since then. Today, however, we are reaching the point where circuits cannot be reduced much further so the rate will slow. 

There are two options available today for long term data storage within the personal computer. The traditional hard drive uses storage disk and a read/write arm to store data for later access even after the device is powered off. Given the movin components this style can develop mechanical issues. The newer solid state drive serves the same function but instead of writing data onto a spinning disk it uses flash memory to store the data. The speed of the SSD is much faster and as a result start up times have decreased. Aditionally, since there are no moving pieces things like dust entering the device or alignment issues don't effect the drive like the would a traditional hard drive.

RAM is a form of shorter term memory that requires power to continue storing data. In order for a computer to run a program it is first stored to the hard drive and then is loaded into RAM where the CPU can access it. When the memory is to low it will be sent back to the hard drive until there is enough room on the RAM for it so the CPU can access it. This significantly slows things down. Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster by increasing the amount of memeory available for data to be stored on which prevents the needed information being sent back to the hard drive in the first place. There are two speeds of RAM to be concerned with typically, 32 bit and 64 bit. Each refers to the number of bits of data transferred in one clock cycle. The old simm model could only transfer 32 bits at a time and is no longer being used in new computers. The newer dimm model is 64 bit so it can transfer twice the data in the same period of time. 
### ALU and the Control Unit
