# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to reveiw and gain a deeper understanding of Operating systems, Python IDLE, and graphics. First, using the command prompt to make a directory and then viewing the directory using the operating system's explorer application is done. Then, a continued study of Python using an Integrated Development and Learning Environment or IDLE will be accomplished. Finally, graphic rendering will be explored, specifically compression and design.Â A vector graphic will be created during this final section as well.
