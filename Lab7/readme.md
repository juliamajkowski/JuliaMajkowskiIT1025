# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to practice working with files and folders and explore the impact of file/folder compression as well as to define the OOP, object oriented programming,
paradigm and practice creating and diagramming software.  
## File Compression
File compression is a useful tool that allows you to group multiple files into one folder in the form of a zip file in order to compress, or make a smaller, file size. This allows
for faster upload/dowload times and makes it easier to share via email or internet. 
When compressing the SVG file from a previous lab, it went from a file size of 75.5 to 40kB. This is different than a JPEG file which typically already is a smaller file
size and cannot be compressed much more.
## Python OOP
In the example, we have the class Shark, which is used as a blueprint to define two functions. Since the functions are under the Shark class they are considered methods. The first is
the method swim(self) and the other is be_awesome(self). When the program is run as is, nothing is returned because an object is needed in order for anything to be returned. 
However, using the constructor method data is initilaized without needing to add an object for the information to be printed. Instead the output can be modified directly. In Python,
a class is where all attributes, like data and functions, are defined. An object however is a specific instance of the class that was defined. You can create a new object of a class 
using instaniation which will allow you to call the method using the object without entering any arguements.
