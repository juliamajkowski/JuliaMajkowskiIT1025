# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to practice working with files and folders and explore the impact of file/folder compression as well as to define the OOP, object oriented programming,
paradigm and practice creating and diagramming software.â€¯ 
## File Compression
File compression is a useful tool that allows you to group multiple files into one folder in the form of a zip file in order to compress, or make a smaller, file size. This allows
for faster upload/dowload times and makes it easier to share via email or internet. 
When compressing the SVG file from a previous lab, it went from a file size of 75.5 to 40kB. This is different than a JPEG file which typically already is a smaller file
size and cannot be compressed much more.
## Python OOP
In the example, we have the class Shark, which is used as a blueprint to define two functions. Since the functions are under the Shark class they are considered methods. The first is
the method swim(self) and the other is be_awesome(self). When the program is run as is, nothing is returned because an object is needed in order for anything to be returned. 
However, using the constructor method data is initilaized without needing to add an object for the information to be printed. Instead the output can be modified directly. In Python,
a class is where all attributes, like data and functions, are defined. An object however is a specific instance of the class that was defined. You can create a new object of a class 
using instaniation which will allow you to call the method using the object without entering any arguements. 
## Object Oriented Concepts
For the Shark class, the instantiatied objects are the names Sammy, Stevie, and Julia. In OOP inheritance is when a class can be ceated out of another class. For example in the shark program, another class could be created from the shark class names to describe a specific type of shark based off of the name. 
Abstractation is used to describe a real life obejct and encapsulation is when this information is then encapsulated into the methods of the class. In the Shark class example, the absractation process would be defining all of the things to be done such as swimming and being awesome. The encapsulation procces then would be these things being put into methods and put into the class. 
# Conslusion
The purpose of this lab was to practice working with files and folders and explore the impact of file/folder compression. Additionally, OOP (object oriented programming) was defined. Finally, practice was done regarding creating and diagramming software. The Python part of the lab was a bit hard to follow and it took a few attempts to get the program to actually run due to spacing and indentation errors. More practice with Python is going to be needed in the future.
