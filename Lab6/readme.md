# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to explore the protocols that provide support for internet communication such as IP, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Additionally the lab will describe Internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page using HTML and CSS.
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
An IP address, or Internet Protocol Addresss, is a set if numbers assigned to a computer network interface. There are two major types of IP, IPV4 and IPV6. IPV4 which was created in the 1980's is a string of four numbers all between 0 and 225 that are separated by dots i.e. 192.0.2.53. IPV6 was standardized in 1996 and is a significantly longer string of numbers that is written in hexadecimal form in order to fit more infomration into fewer digits. The segments of IP in IPV6 are separated by colons such as 2001:0db8::53.
