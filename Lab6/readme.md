# Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to explore the protocols that provide support for internet communication such as IP, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Additionally the lab will describe Internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page using HTML and CSS.
## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
An IP address, or Internet Protocol Addresss, is a set if numbers assigned to a computer network interface. There are two major types of IP, IPV4 and IPV6. IPV4 which was created in the 1980's is a string of four numbers all between 0 and 225 that are separated by dots i.e. 192.0.2.53. IPV6 was standardized in 1996 and is a significantly longer string of numbers that is written in hexadecimal form in order to fit more infomration into fewer digits. The segments of IP in IPV6 are separated by colons such as 2001:0db8::53. 

ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is a major contributor to the global internet. They are the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions. This means that they allocate IP addresses to the five regional internet registeries which then allocate them to smaller operators which eventually assign them to the individual internet connections we are used to encountering. 
### TCP/IP
TCP/IP, Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol, is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and recieved through the various network hardware components. It follows the client server model using a device as the client and another device as a server too. Information is sent when the client knows the IP address of the server so information can be sent. 
When using TCP/IP a layered protocol stack is one of the smartest ways to do it. This approach allows for one part of the protocol to be changed without affecting the other layers of it. With the frequency of changes in technology, you do not want to have to constantly rewrite yourr entire protocol. This method allows for specific parts to be changed as needed instead of haing to change the entire thing. 
In the application layer, things like software will run using protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, and SNMP.
